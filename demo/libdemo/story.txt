Patch, a small brown dog, liked sticks. Not big logs, but good, sturdy sticks. He'd find them in the park, chew them a bit, then carry them home.

One day, he found a long, straight stick. It was perfect. He held it high, tail wagging, and ran toward his human, a boy named Tom.

Tom was sad. He sat on a bench, head down. Patch dropped the stick at Tom's feet. Tom looked up.

Patch barked, a happy sound. He nudged the stick. Tom picked it up, and threw it. Patch ran, fast as he could, and brought it back.

Tom threw the stick again. And again. Patch fetched it every time. Tom started to smile. He threw the stick far, and Patch ran and ran.

When they went home, Tom held the stick. "Thanks, Patch," he said. Patch licked his hand. He was a good dog, and he made his friend happy.
